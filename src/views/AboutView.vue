    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This project is created from a love of reading and notetaking combined to make it easy to quote parts of a text that are very helpful in context of projects I am working on at the moment.</p>
    <p>In the future different books will be available from a permanent storage. Notes will be stored in that permanent storage as well.</p>
